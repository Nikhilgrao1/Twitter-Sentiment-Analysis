1. The Porter Stemming Algorithm
    The Porter stemming algorithm (or ‘Porter stemmer’) is a process for removing the commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words in English. Its main use is as part of a term normalisation process that is usually done when setting up Information Retrieval systems.

3. Naive Bayes classifier for multinomial models
    The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). The multinomial distribution normally requires integer feature counts. However, in practice, fractional counts such as tf-idf may also work.

4. sklearn.metrics.classification_report
    sklearn.metrics.classification_report(y_true, y_pred, *, labels=None, target_names=None, sample_weight=None, digits=2, output_dict=False, zero_division='warn')[source]
        Build a text report showing the main classification metrics.
